The code snippets are present in download_data.py, analyse_data.py although i had errors so the outputs that i could get were mentioned in the report PROSPACE_REPORT.pdf, the png files are plotted using matplotlib, and i couldnt download all the sectors data using yfinance since i couldnt figure out the errors. But to the best of my knowledge and from online sources i could get till this far.
